# Electric-Vehicle-EV-Data-Analysis-using-Python
Analyzed EV dataset with Python to solve a customer budget-range query, compared Tesla vs. Audi motor power using hypothesis testing, and highlighted key EV features for manufacturers.  

---

## Overview  
This project explores the Electric Vehicle (EV) market using Python to analyze the FEV dataset. The focus was on understanding EV specifications such as range, price, battery capacity, and motor power. The project included solving customer-specific queries, comparing brand performance, and providing recommendations for manufacturers.  



## Methods & Techniques  
- **Data Analysis:** Cleaned, filtered, and visualized EV data using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib  
- **Customer Query Filtering:** Extracted EV models based on customer-defined constraints for budget and desired range  
- **Statistical Testing:** Conducted hypothesis testing (t-tests) with SciPy to compare Tesla and Audi motor power  
- **Market Review:** Evaluated factors like battery capacity, range, and charging speed to highlight competitive differentiators  



## Key Findings  
- **Customer Query Solution:** Identified EVs (Audi e-tron, BMW iX3, Hyundai Kona) that matched a budget limit of 350,000 PLN and the customerâ€™s minimum desired range.  
- **Statistical Comparison:** Hypothesis testing showed no significant difference in motor power between Tesla and Audi, meaning engine power is not a strong factor when comparing these brands.  
- **Manufacturer Recommendation:** Emphasized features such as longer battery range, efficient capacity, and faster charging as key differentiators in the EV market.  



## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy  
- **Statistical Methods:** Hypothesis testing (t-test)  
- **Dataset:** FEV-data dataset (electric vehicle specifications)  



## Outcome  
The project provided a structured EV data analysis that:  
- Helped address a specific customer query by filtering EVs under budget and with required range  
- Compared Tesla and Audi to determine if motor power was a differentiating factor  
- Suggested focus areas for manufacturers to improve their EV offerings
